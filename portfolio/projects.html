            <div class="section-title"><b>Penetration Testing</b></div>
            <p class="des">
                Recent years have seen a rapidly increasing rise in data breaches and cyberattacks, making it more important than ever to ensure your systems contain no vulnerabilities that attackers can use to gain access to sensitive data or to shut down your network. Working with a good penetration tester is like having a hacker on your side; using the same skill set as potential attackers, they look for ways to find and exploit any vulnerabilities you may have. But, instead of using these vulnerabilities for gain, they work with you to help eliminate those vulnerabilities. Hiring candidates with strong penetration testing skills will make your systems safer, as they will be able to track down and report vulnerabilities before attackers find them.
                
                This penetration testing test evaluates candidate’s overall pentesting skills, including their ability to apply basic security concepts, ethically discover and exploit vulnerabilities, and work professionally with clients.
                
                This screening test will help you identify penetration testers who can uncover attack vectors that can threaten your businesses. Candidates who do well on this test will competently identify vulnerabilities, contributing effectively to the security of your organization</p>

            <p class="des">
                Face detection uses machine learning (ML) and artificial neural network (ANN) technology, and plays an important role in face tracking, face analysis and facial recognition. In face analysis, face detection uses facial expressions to identify which parts of an image or video should be focused on to determine age, gender and emotions. In a facial recognition system, face detection data is required to generate a faceprint and match it with other stored faceprints.
